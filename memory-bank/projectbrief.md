# Trip Planner Project Brief

## Project Overview

Trip Planner is an intelligent travel planning system that helps users create personalized travel itineraries using AI agents. The system combines multiple specialized agents to handle different aspects of trip planning, including search, entertainment, meals, and accommodations.

## Core Requirements

### 1. System Architecture

- Multi-agent system using Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
- Integration with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Modular design with specialized agents for different travel aspects
- Asynchronous communication between agents

### 2. Core Functionalities

- Trip itinerary generation based on user preferences
- Intelligent search for destinations and attractions
- Entertainment and activity recommendations
- Restaurant and dining suggestions
- Accommodation booking assistance
- Plan optimization based on time and budget constraints

### 3. AI Integration

- Multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
- Context-aware conversation handling
- Structured response generation
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 4. User Experience

- Simple and intuitive interface
- Real-time response generation
- Flexible preference configuration
- Clear and organized trip plans

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Backend

- Python-based implementation
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- Async/await for concurrent operations
- Modular agent architecture

### 2. AI/LLM Integration

- Multiple provider support
- Configurable model parameters
- Conversation context management
- Response structure standardization

### 3. Agent Communication

- A2A protocol implementation
- ADK tool integration
- Message queue handling
- Error recovery mechanisms

### 4. Data Management

- Configuration management
- Environment variable handling
- Caching mechanisms
- Logging and monitoring

## Project Scope

- Phase 1: Core agent implementation and basic trip planning
- Phase 2: Enhanced AI integration and optimization
- Phase 3: User interface and experience improvements
- Phase 4: Advanced features and integrations

## Success Criteria

1. Successful generation of coherent trip plans
2. Effective communication between agents
3. Reliable AI/LLM integration
4. Responsive user experience
5. Scalable and maintainable architecture

## Constraints

1. API rate limits and costs
2. Response time requirements
3. Resource utilization
4. Security considerations

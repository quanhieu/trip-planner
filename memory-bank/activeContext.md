## Current Focus

1. Implementing AI integration with multiple providers
2. Developing core agent functionality
3. Setting up basic communication patterns
4. Creating initial UI components
5. Optimizing model selection strategy
6. Improving error handling and resilience

## Recent Changes

1. Enhanced ModelSelector implementation:
   - Added sophisticated scoring system for model selection (40/30/30 weights)
   - Implemented robust task-specific complexity analysis
   - Centralized model configurations in settings
   - Updated fallback model to gpt-4o-mini
   - Improved error handling with detailed logging
   - Added validation of inputs and edge cases
2. Updated environment configuration:
   - Aligned .env.template with actual code requirements
   - Set DEFAULT_MODEL to gpt-4o
   - Added proper settings for all agents
3. Implemented multi-agent system with:
   - Search Agent (factual queries and information extraction)
   - Entertainment Agent (activity planning)
   - Meal Agent (dining recommendations)
   - Stay Agent (accommodation planning)
   - Orchestrator Agent (coordination and integration)
4. Established error handling patterns:
   - Standardized logging across all agents
   - Comprehensive exception handling
   - Fallback mechanisms for failed model selection

## Next Steps

1. Complete agent implementations with remaining features:
   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Entertainment optimization
   - Meal preference handling
   - Stay amenity filtering
2. Implement additional plan optimization algorithms
3. Develop UI components for real-time interaction
4. Add comprehensive testing framework
5. Validate model selection performance with metrics
6. Implement error tracking and recovery strategies

## Active Decisions

### 1. Architecture Decisions

- Using A2A protocol for agent communication
- Implementing ADK integration for AI capabilities
- Supporting multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic)
- Adopting async/await patterns for improved performance
- Implementing weighted scoring for model selection
- Using Docker for containerization and deployment

### 2. Implementation Decisions

- Python as primary language with FastAPI framework
- FastAPI for API endpoints with async support
- Streamlit for UI development
- Docker for deployment and service isolation
- Task-specific complexity analysis for model selection
- Centralized configuration management

### 3. AI Integration Decisions

- Supporting multiple providers with unified interface
- Implementing intelligent fallback mechanisms with multiple layers
- Standardizing response formats across all models
- Managing conversation context for improved coherence
- Using weighted scoring for model selection:
  - 40% strength match (task requirement alignment)
  - 30% complexity match (computational efficiency)
  - 30% cost efficiency (budget optimization)
- Adding detailed logging for model selection decisions

## Current Challenges

1. Optimizing response times across different models
2. Managing API costs with smart model selection
3. Handling service interruptions gracefully
4. Ensuring consistent response quality across providers
5. Fine-tuning model selection weights for optimal results
6. Balancing performance and cost considerations
7. Ensuring model selection works correctly in edge cases

## Open Questions

1. Scaling strategy for high-traffic scenarios
2. Caching implementation for repeated queries
3. Error recovery mechanisms for critical failures
4. Testing approach for model selection
5. Model selection performance metrics and evaluation
6. Strategies for handling API rate limits
7. Approach for model version compatibility
